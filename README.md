# Hack Assembler
This project was an implementation of the assembler for `nand2tetris` in Ruby.  It runs as a command line script.

#### How to run it.
`cd` into the `bin` directory and `./hacksemble path/to/asmfile.asm`
It should split out a bunch of binary code that you can run in the nand2tetris cpu emulator.
